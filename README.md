# Git Going  
A git repository scaffolding utility that I am writing for myself 

## Initial features
The initial implementation of this CLI will allow you to create a fully scaffolded local and remote repository with a single command. 

Initially, this scaffolding will consist of the following steps: 

* Creating a local directory, ensuring no conflicts
* Initializing it as a git repo 
* Creating a remote github repo 
* Setting the remote origin for the local repository 
* Generating boilerplate for a README, LICENSE, .gitignore, etc
